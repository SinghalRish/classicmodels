Overview
This repository demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Power BI, based on the ClassicModels database. ClassicModels is a sample database typically used for educational purposes, representing a retail company selling products worldwide. It contains several key tables such as customers, orders, products, employees, and more.

In this project, I use Power BI to explore and derive insights from the ClassicModels dataset by building interactive dashboards and reports.

Key Features
Data Import & Preparation: The ClassicModels dataset is loaded into Power BI, where tables are connected via relationships for streamlined analysis.
Data Transformation: Basic data cleaning and transformation tasks are performed using Power BIâ€™s Power Query editor, including renaming columns, formatting data, and creating new calculated columns and measures.
Interactive Dashboards: A series of Power BI reports are designed, offering insights into various aspects of the business:
Sales performance by region and product
Customer segmentation and behavior analysis
Employee performance metrics
Monthly and yearly trends in revenue and profit
Visualizations: Various Power BI charts and visuals are employed, such as bar charts, line charts, slicers, and matrix tables, to provide an intuitive understanding of business data.
